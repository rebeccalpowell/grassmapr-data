All data sets are 10min (0.1666667 deg) spatial resolution
Resampled to the same spatial grid and extent (to match CRU global data)

Climate Layers:
cru_pre_10min.tif - monthly precipitation (mm/month)
cru_tmn_10min.tif - mean monthly min temperature (deg C) 
cru_tmp_10min.tif - mean monthly temperature (deg C)
cru_tmx_10min.tif - mean monthly max temperature (deg C) 

Harmonized Vegetation Layers:
c3_crop_cov_2000_10min.tif - percent c3 crop cover (adjusted for multicropping)
c4_crop_cov_2000_10min.tif - percent c4 crop cover (adjusted for multicropping)
vcf_tree_crown_2001_10min.tif - percent tree crown cover 

Greenness Index:
ndvi_2001_10min - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MOD13A3 v006)

* Vegetation layers are stored as FLOAT. Climate layers are stored as INT.
